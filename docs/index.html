It not only allows us to hear the “voice” of our patients and families through video testimonials, written and e-mailed letters, and social media posts, but allows us to connect with and inspire others. These stories kickstart all meetings, educational sessions, and presentations, allowing for a moment of grounding and gratitude, and often reminding us of our “why.” This year presented incredible patient stories, highlighting care from several areas across the organization, including the Katz Institute for Women’s Health, Cohen Children’s Medical Center, Huntington Hospital, the cancer service line, maternal health, vascular surgery, financial services, and the volunteer experience.

          <p class="text-[15px] md:text-[16px] lg:text-[17px] mb-4 leading-snug font-polaris font-medium">Over the past year, education has taken center stage. The Office of Patient and Customer Experience (OPCE) has strategically employed a mix of learning modalities to address the diverse training and developmental needs of our team members. Implementing various approaches has been crucial in meeting the increased demand for customized site-based sessions. While staying true to fundamental concepts, OPCE consistently evolves the Culture of C.A.R.E., our commitment to patients and families, ensuring that the curriculum remains relevant and adaptable. The expanded range of course offerings has emphasized the significance of Culture of C.A.R.E. train-the-trainer workshops, educating over 100 prospective champions on the updated content and facilitation skills.</p>
          <p class="text-[15px] md:text-[16px] lg:text-[17px] leading-snug font-polaris font-medium">A noteworthy educational initiative includes the ongoing Relationship-Centered Communication (RCC) course. Rooted in the Culture of C.A.R.E., RCC is an immersive learning program with minimal didactics, placing a primary focus on experiential learning in communication skills through role play, real-time mentoring, and coaching. It goes beyond purely lessons; it embodies a language deeply grounded in evidence-based communication, seamlessly bridging the gap between patients and providers, essential for authentic empathy. The success of the program has gained recognition from the Journal of Patient Experience, which published a narrative titled “From Monologue to Dialogue: The Pursuit of Relationship-Centered Communication Across a Large, Integrated Healthcare System.”</p>

Therefore, the OPCE Business Intelligence team has partnered with regional ambulatory culture leaders and operational leadership on the deployment of a continuous process improvement model designed to proactively identify practice locations with patient experience improvement needs. Leveraging our regional support model, the team engages each region on a quarterly cadence with a list of locations with the greatest opportunity for improvement. The analysis is based on quantitative and qualitative feedback that is trended and benchmarked both internally and externally. Locations that are deemed ‘change ready’ by regional leadership are then activated onto a Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) improvement cycle with specific improvement goals. As local practice management leads the improvement effort with support from regional operations leadership, the OPCE BI team delivers ongoing analytics, best practice, knowledge management, and progress tracking support. Every quarter, active PDSA locations are evaluated for a disposition of ‘Graduate’, ‘Extend’, or ‘Discontinue’ while new locations are activated to offset the graduated and discontinued efforts.</p>

In addition to the quantitative and qualitative insights we gather in the roughly 500,000 Patient Experience surveys we get each year, we also have access to a wealth of data captured from the patient’s clinical encounter. This is all used to enhance our dashboards with more explanatory data and allows us to produce more in-depth analyses for the organization. However, that depth of and breadth of data comes at a cost, and we’ve realized that we’ve hit the physical limitations of our traditional business intelligence environment. To truly push the envelope of services we provide we need to take advantage of a modern data platform that will grow with us as we grow our team. We have partnered with the Northwell Health Cloud Center of Excellence to migrate our data architecture to the cloud. This will enable us to continue to enhance the services we provide while the organization grows around us, as well as offer new capabilities that we had previously been unable to provide due to resource constraints. This includes deeper insights to the patient experience, increased self-service capabilities, and customizable on-demand reporting beyond the Tableau dashboards.</p>

Additionally, patient experience profiling techniques will enable Northwell to create comprehensive profiles for each patient, incorporating demographic information, medical history, and communication preferences.</p>

Northwell has spearheaded this space as recognized by numerous spotlights on national television, podcasts, national presentations, research journals, and other prestigious publications such as PEOPLE magazine, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal and Becker’s Healthcare Review. The quality of the food reached its all-time high in 2023, consistently ranking in the 84 percentile. Northwell signed partnership agreements with The Center for Discovery in Monticello, NY, along with local Queens County Farm to procure fresh produce, and to open education throughout the community on what it means to “eat healthy.”</p>

Another highlight was the addition of a standardized nutrition screen malnutrition screening tool (MST) to Nursing risk screens. This enabled timely nutrition care to patients at nutritional risk potentially reducing length of stay and readmission rates. Malnutrition toolkits for team education were enhanced and system policies were updated. Looking ahead, we continue to grow and develop CSA partnerships for local, fresh produce in our hospitals.</p>

A major celebration took place when Northwell was awarded a PFAC-tor award for ‘Excellence in Patient Family Advisory Councils for System Wide Partnerships.” An additional highlight was the addition of 53 new PFPC members across the health system. Caregiving also remains a priority with growth to 9 total Caregiver Centers system-wide, including the grand opening of the Phelps Hospital Caregiver Center. In addition, the Northwell presentation selected to be featured at the national 2023 Press Ganey Conference was on Caregiving, presented by Tara Anglim, Alyssa McCready, and Kacey Farber. Continued development, sustainment, and expansion of Patient & Family Partnership Councils, as well as Caregiver Centers throughout the organization remain a key focus in 2024.</p>

In a post-program survey, 100% of interns shared that they would recommend this program to a friend and participate again, if given the opportunity. To date, Northwell has hired approximately 30% of this program’s interns solidifying it as a pipeline program.

Covering an enhanced Culture of C.A.R.E. with an emphasis on patient access and patient accommodation, the AAA aims to set behavioral and professional expectations by impressing Northwell values, empower new team members with baseline tools and education to be “ready to work”, and build a standard approach to key functions in ambulatory practices.</p>
          <p class="text-[15px] font-polaris font-medium">The AAA launched in a phased approach – first by engaging, celebrating, and empowering our Practice Leadership. These in-person mandatory half-day sessions explore best practices that can address the evolving landscape of healthcare management and provide tools and strategies to support access and elevate patient care and experience. Since the launch in February 2024, close to 500 practice leaders completed the workshop. The second phase of the AAA will focus on the newly hired ambulatory administrative team members. During the two-week training, the AAA will cover enhanced Culture of C.A.R.E. with an emphasis on patient access and patient accommodation, hands-on scheduling technology training and best practices, telephony operations and etiquette, revenue cycle practices, digital front door tools, and become the future home to new digital technology training such as Salesforce.</p>

Teams held special events at their sites, focusing on gratitude, employee appreciation, wellness and self-care activities, and educational forums. An exciting highlight was when OPCE leadership visited the sites, units, and ambulatory practices to present them with North Star 90 and Rising Star awards! These esteemed awards are given to those sites who go above and beyond in patient experience during the year.</p>
